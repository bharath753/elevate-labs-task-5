 Capturing and Analyzing Network Traffic Using Wireshark

Network protocol: A network protocol is a set of rules that govern data communication between different devices in the network. It determines what is being communicated, how it is being communicated, and when it is being communicated. It permits connected devices to communicate with each other, irrespective of internal and structural differences.
Types :
Network Communication
Network Management
Network Security

Tools used: Wireshark
Wireshark can be downloaded both in kali linux and Windows operating system
It is a free tool that can be downloaded through any browser 
After downloading we have to open which contains traffic 
Then we have to start capturing which contains traffic
stop capturing after a minute and filter search by using protocol like tcp, udp
In another way you can find ip address of any website using command prompt by typing the command 'nslookup' and then enter the website url
After getting the ip adress paste it in the filter section with command "ip.addr ==[ip address]"
Here I entered the protocal name tcp,udp,http in the filter section and saved the data of each protocol seperately.
By using this we can analysis the   Capturing and Analyzing Network Traffic.
